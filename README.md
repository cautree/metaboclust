MetaboliteLevels project

Compile using VisualStudio. You'll need to get the MSerialiser and MChart libraries too.
VS will complain that they are missing so you'll have to add them.
NuGet will automatically download the missing public libraries: Math.NET and RDotNet.

The application runs as a stand-alone (it doesn't require any special install) and contains full instructions in-line.
