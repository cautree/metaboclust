[Session]
Name your session here.

Try to be descriptve, the software will allow you to display a shorter name and add comments to your session later, but this is the name you will see when loading your data.

Your name also acts as a unique identifier the software uses to remember which files and settings you used to create the session, in case you want to create new, similar sessions later (Use the HISTORY button on this screen to access this feature).

DETAILS: Accepts any text

[LC-MS Mode]
Specifies the LC-MS mode.

This is used to determine which adducts are available during compound identification.

If no compound identification is required then select "none". This may be the case when using NMR data or if compounds have already been identified.
If the data contains both positive and negative LC data then this should be set to "mixed", in which case the mode for each peak must be specified in the peak info file.

EXPECTS: "positive", "negative", "mixed" OR "none".

[k-means++]
This process starts with a "seed" variable to act as an exemplar. The distance of all other variables to this variable is then calculated. The most distant variable is then used as a second exemplar. The variable most distant from their closest exemplar acts as a third exemplar and so forth. The process is repeated until all variables fall within a certain distance range of the exemplars, or optionally until a certain number of exemplars are generated. These exemplars then act as the centres in a standard k-means clustering.


[ClusterRScript]
Clusters based on R script.
The script should use the variable "s" (the distance matrix) and return cluster IDs (integer numeric vector).

[ClusteringRScriptExample]
kmeans(v, 3)$cluster

[StatisticsRScriptExample]
kmeans(v, 3)$cluster

[Unable to load session]
The selected session could not be loaded.

* The file may be missing or corrupt.
* The file may have been saved using a version of the application which isn't compatible with the current version.

Please recreate the session from the original files.

[RScript Editor]
Specify the code for your algorithm.

You can use "##" to give names to script parameters, for example the number of clusters "k" in k-means might be specified as:

## k = integer

The available parameter types are: integer, double

Standard inputs are also provided, for instance clustering requires a value matrix

## x = value.matrix

The available inputs for the type of algorithm you are editing are shown in the caption below the title bar.
If you don't specify an input they will be given the names shown in the title bar.

Some inputs are optional since they and are represented by a dash "-" by default, meaning unused. Give these inputs a name to use them in your code. For instance your clustering algorithm might not need the value matrix to be created, so it can choose use the distance matrix directly instead.

[SaveData]
Data can be saved in sereral formats.
MS-NRFB is the fastest and most compact format and is recommended for speed and reliability, however this format is unfortunately unable to cope with large object graph sizes (i.e. datasets with lots of discrete objects), the MJR-SBF format provides a fallback in this case.
MJR-SBF also provides a higher degree of backwards compatibility, making it useful for migrating data between software versions.
The MJR-STF format is identical to MJR-SBF but stores the data as text. Due to the memory and speed overhead of the text format MJR-STF is only recommended as a version comatible text backup.
XML and Data contract formats have been removed and are no longer supported.
Other formats, including RData and CSV (text) are available as export only options from the Export menu.
