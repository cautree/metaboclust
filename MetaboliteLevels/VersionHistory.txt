VERSION 1.0.0.59
* Introduces the option to select different icons and drawing styles for different experimental groups.

    If you are loading files created with a previous version then the new style settings will be unset and your graphs may look odd.
    Please use the group editor ([Edit -> Experimental groups...] on the main menu) to set the icons and styles for your experimental groups.

* Fixes an issue where new files aren't added to the "recent sessions" menu.

* Refines PCA dialogue
